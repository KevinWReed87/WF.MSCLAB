- Current threats: Here, you can see any threats that have been detected on your device. You can see when the last scan occurred, how long the scan took, and how many files were scanned. Here you can also click the button to start a quick scan or access scan options to run a full scan or a custom scan.

- Virus & threat protection settings: Here, you can access options for managing your virus and threat protection settings. You can customize your protection level, opt to send sample files to Microsoft, exclude files or folders from scans, or temporarily stop your protection.

- Virus & threat protection updates: Here, you can view the last time your virus definitions were updated. You can also opt to manually check for updates.

- Ransomware protection: Here, you can choose to enable controlled folder access. This protects memory, files, and folders from unauthorized changes.

<h2>Update Threat Definitions</h2>

Windows Security uses security intelligence, also known as definitions, to identify known threats. These definitions include information about known threats. These definitions are updated automatically, but if you suspect a problem with your system, you should ensure that threat definitions are up-to-date before you run a scan.

- Under Virus & threat protection updates, select Check for updates.

<h2>Run Antivirus Quick Scan</h2>

Now we can run an antivirus scan. Click the Quick scan button on the Virus & threat protection screen. The scan will take several minutes to run. When complete, the Quick scan button will reappear.

- Click Threat history to view any recent findings.

This page shows you the results of the last scan. You see the files identified as a threat and quarantined, so they cannot damage your device. You then see files identified as potential threats but allowed to continue running.

<h2>Run A Custom Scan</h2>

- I will run a custom scan that only scans the files in the Downloads folder.

No files are present in the Downloads folder for this lab, the scan will not find anything to scan. In a custom scan, you can usually select specific files or folders to include in the scan. This is just a example of how it would be conducted.

<h2>Configure Firewall Rules Using Windows Defender Firewall</h2>

In this lab I will review Windows Defender Firewall configuration.

- Click the Windows Start button. and then select Windows Security.
